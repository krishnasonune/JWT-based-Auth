# JSON Web Token based Authentication & Authorization

In this impressive project developed using ASP.NET Core, I have successfully showcased the implementation of a secure and efficient user authentication and authorization system using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). The project not only demonstrates a fundamental understanding of web application security but also highlights my proficiency in using ASP.NET Core and related technologies.

The primary focus of this project is to highlight the seamless integration of JWT-based authentication and authorization mechanisms within an ASP.NET Core application. By leveraging JWTs, which are compact and digitally signed tokens, this project ensures secure transmission of user identity and authorizes access to protected resources by decoding the payload within the token.


## Features

- Robust JWT authentication for secure user login and registration.
- Secure payload encoding to protect user data confidentiality and integrity.
- Authorization via payload decoding, allowing - granular control based on user roles and attributes.
- Seamless integration with ASP.NET Core, utilizing middleware, controllers, and dependency injection.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for assigning varying levels of access and permissions.
- Token validation to ensure authenticity and guard against tampering.
- Error handling and logging for a smooth user experience and efficient troubleshooting.
